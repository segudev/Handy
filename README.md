     - Customize model parameters
5. Start using voice commands with the default shortcuts!

## Environment Variables

The app automatically detects and uses common environment variables:
```bash
# Remote API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# Model Configuration
DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4  # Example model choice
MODEL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080  # For custom API endpoints
```

## Configuration

The app allows you to configure:
- AI Model Settings:
  - Model provider (local or remote)
  - API endpoints and keys
  - Model parameters (temperature, context length, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Window preferences for AI chat
- Transcription settings

## Development Setup
